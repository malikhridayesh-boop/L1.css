    <p id="para1">
        Association football, more commonly known as football or soccer, is a team sport played between two teams of 11
        players who almost exclusively use their feet to propel a ball around a rectangular field called a pitch.
        
        The objective of the game is to score more goals than the opposing team by moving the ball beyond the goal line into a
        rectangular-framed goal defended by the opponent. Traditionally, the game has been played over two 45-minute halves, for
        a total match time of 90 minutes. With an estimated 250 million players active in over 200 countries and territories, it
        is the world's most popular sport.
        
        Association football is played in accordance with the Laws of the Game, a set of rules that has been in effect since
        1863 and maintained by the IFAB since 1886. The game is played with a football that is 68-70 cm (27-28 in) in
        circumference. The two teams compete to score goals by getting the ball into the other team's goal (between the posts,
        under the bar, and fully across the goal line). When the ball is in play, the players mainly use their feet, but may
        also use any other part of their body, except for their hands or arms, to control, strike, or pass the ball; the head,
        chest, and thighs are commonly used. Only the goalkeepers may use their hands and arms, but they may use their hands
        only within their own penalty area. The team that has scored more goals at the end of the game is the winner. Depending
        on the format of the competition, an equal number of goals scored may result in a draw being declared with 1 point
        awarded to each team, or the game may go into extra time or a penalty shoot-out.

        Internationally, association football is governed by FIFA. Under FIFA, there are six continental confederations: AFC,
        CAF, CONCACAF, CONMEBOL, OFC, and UEFA. National associations (e.g. the FA in England, U.S. Soccer in the United States,
        etc.) are responsible for managing the game in their own countries both professionally and at an amateur level, and
        coordinating competitions in accordance with the Laws of the Game. The most prestigious senior international competition
        is the FIFA World Cup. The men's World Cup is the most-viewed sporting event in the world, surpassing the Olympic
        Games.The most prestigious competition in European club football is the UEFA Champions League, which attracts an
        extensive television audience worldwide. The final of the men's Champions League is the most-watched annual sporting
        event in the world.

        Association football is part of a family of football codes that emerged from various ball games played worldwide since
        antiquity. The word "association" in this term refers to the Football Association (the FA), founded in London in 1863,
        which published the first set of rules for the sport that same year.The term was coined to distinguish the type of
        football played in accordance with the FA rules from other types that were gaining popularity at the time, particularly
        rugby football.
